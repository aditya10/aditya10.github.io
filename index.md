üëã Hello there! 

I work at the Computer Vision Lab at University of British Columbia with [Dr. Leonid Sigal](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lsigal/index.html) and [Dr. Renjie Liao](https://lrjconan.github.io). My interests lie in multimodal vision-language models, time-series models, and commonsense reasoning. Currently, I am an intern at [Borealis AI](https://www.borealisai.com), working with [Dr. Fred Tung](https://www.borealisai.com/team-member/fred-tung/).

In addition, I am a photographer in the city. I enjoy doing landscape and product photography. My work has over [100 million views on Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@adityachinchure). You can find my latest work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aditya.chinchure/).

If you are reading this, I would love to talk to you! I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate. Also, my inbox is open if you have any questions about student life at UBC or Vancouver. Message me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aditya.chinchure/) or send me an [email](mailto:aditya.chinchure+web@gmail.com).
