üëã Hello there! 

I work at the Computer Vision Lab at University of British Columbia with [Dr. Leonid Sigal](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lsigal/index.html) and [Dr. Renjie Liao](https://lrjconan.github.io). My interests lie in multimodal vision-language models, time-series models, and commonsense reasoning. Currently, I am an intern at [Borealis AI](https://www.borealisai.com).

In addition, I am a photographer in the city. I enjoy doing landscape and product photography. My work has over [100 million views on Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@adityachinchure). You can find my latest work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aditya.chinchure/).

If you are reading this, I would love to talk to you! I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate. Also, my inbox is open if you have any questions about student life at UBC or Vancouver. Message me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aditya.chinchure/) or send me an [email](mailto:aditya.chinchure+web@gmail.com).

## üé≥ Projects

**Graph-enhanced Transformers for Referring Expressions Comprehension** \
We explore a simple method to incorporate inter-token relationships in a Transformer before performing any training, using graphs with edge features. In VL-BERT-Graph, we generate a fully-connected graph of input tokens where the edges represent similarity between the tokens, obtained using GloVE and CLIP. We then use a message-passing GNN to incorporate these features into the input tokens or the output encoding of the model, and train the Transformer with edge-feature attention masks. \

**A Summary of Recent Text Summarization Techniques** \
In this project paper, we surveyed text summarization models by evaluating existing extractive and abstractive models. We studied the metrics and datasets used to evaluate the latest models and evaluated upcoming abstractive techniques. Finally, we highlighted future pathways for text summarization and suggested areas for improvement. \
