👋 Hello there! 

I am a PhD student at the Computer Vision and NLP Labs at University of British Columbia. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Leonid Sigal](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lsigal/index.html) and [Dr. Vered Shwartz](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~vshwartz/), and supported by the highly competitive [UBC Four Year Fellowship (4YF)](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/awards/four-year-doctoral-fellowship-4yf).

My research focus is on applying methods from _human reasoning and cognition_ to develop vision-language models 👁️ and evaluation tools 🛠️. I have worked on image and video understanding & reasoning, as well as bias and fairness in Generative AI.

I am an incoming research intern at [Ideogram](https://ideogram.ai/t/explore). Previously, I was a visiting scholar at [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago](https://ttic.edu), working with [Dr. Matthew Turk](https://home.ttic.edu/~mturk/), and an intern at [Borealis AI](https://www.borealisai.com) with [Dr. Fred Tung](https://www.borealisai.com/team-member/fred-tung/). In addition, I enjoy doing photography as a hobby. My work has over [200 million views on Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@adityachinchure). You can find my latest photos on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jpgs.by.adi/).

If you are reading this, I would love to talk to you! I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate. Also, my inbox is open if you have any questions about student life at UBC or Vancouver. Message me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jpgs.by.adi/) or send me an [email](mailto:aditya.chinchure+web@gmail.com).
