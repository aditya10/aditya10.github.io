I"Ó<p>Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. I work in the Computer Vision Lab with Dr. Leonid Sigal and Dr. Renjie Liao. My interests lie in multimodal vision-language models, time-series models, and commonsense reasoning.</p>

<p>In addition, I am a photographer in the city. I enjoy doing landscape and product photography. My work has over 100 million views on Unsplash.</p>

<p>If you are reading this, I would love to talk to you! I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate on photography or computer science projects. Also, my inbox is open if you have any questions about student life at UBC or Vancouver. Message me on Instagram or send me an email anytime.</p>
